# shopping-cart-exercise

This was a programming exercise that I found online which is used to demonstrate a developers ability to deliver well
structured and maintainable code. This would also be an opportunity to show how applications can be written in a
Test Driven Development(TDD) manner. 

In a real world situation I would ensure (where possible) that each commit passes the tests. However I thought by
splitting up the commits more, it would clearly show how I have written my code in a TDD approach. 

I have highlighted the steps of the exercise below. 


### Step 1: Shopping cart 

* Use a simple Console App to demonstrate the code functions and to output the results. You are not required to add
input support to the Console App. 
* You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges. 
* Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
* Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost. 
For example: [Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple] => Â£2.05
* Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solutions. 

### Step 2: Simple offers

* The shop decides to introduce two new offers;
* buy one, get one free on Apples. 
* 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges.
